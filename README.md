USB Charger

Several years ago, I got the idea that I wanted to make a USB charger for my desk.  We had just purchased the FormLabs Form 2., and when we printed with the blue transparent resin, I figured it would make a really cool, err, umm... police phone box.

The charger board sits in the base of the, um, police phone box.  Theres a wire for a white LED to run up inside and sit in the top of the phone box.  The embedded PIC32 watches the current flowing into the device and creates a heart-beat pattern on the LED proportional to the amount of charging current.  When your device is done, the LED turns itself off.

It looked really cool.  Its surprising how many fans of blue, british police phone boxes there are!  I ended up making one for a bunch of people in the lab, and even our provost!
